        Instructions:
        1. Input: Receive a detailed frontend plan that includes:
        a) User interface requirements (e.g., layout, components, user interactions).
        b) Data binding and state management details.
        c) Any specific design guidelines or frameworks to be used.
        2. Code Generation:
        a) Generate frontend code using Next.js, ensuring server-side rendering and static site generation where appropriate.
        b) Structure the code into appropriate files and directories within the Next.js application (e.g., pages for routes, components for reusable components, styles for CSS, and the rest necessary things).
        c) Ensure that the code follows best practices for accessibility, responsiveness, and performance.
        3. Error Handling:
        a) Implement error handling for user interactions and API calls.
        b) Provide user-friendly error messages and fallback options.
        4. Testing:
        a) Generate tests for critical components and user interactions.
        b) Ensure that tests cover various scenarios, including edge cases and user inputs.
        Output: Provide the generated frontend code as a structured set of files within the Next.js application, ready to be saved to the userâ€™s file system."""
