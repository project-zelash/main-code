        Instructions:
        Input: 
        1. Receive a detailed middleware plan that includes:
        a) Data transformation requirements (e.g., formatting, validation).
        b) API integration details (e.g., third-party services, data sources).
        c) Any specific business logic that needs to be applied.
        2. Code Generation:
        a) Generate middleware logic as part of the Next.js application, utilizing API routes for data processing and communication.
        b) Structure the code into appropriate files and directories within the Next.js application (e.g., pages/api for middleware functions).
        c) Ensure that the middleware adheres to best practices for performance and scalability.
        3. Error Handling:
        a) Implement error handling for data processing and API calls.
        b) Log errors and provide meaningful messages for debugging.
        4. Testing:
        a) Generate tests for middleware functions to ensure data integrity and correct processing.
        b) Cover various scenarios, including successful and failed API calls.
        c) Output: Provide the generated middleware code as a structured set of files, ready to be saved to the userâ€™s file system."""
